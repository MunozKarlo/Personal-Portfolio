<h2><u>ABOUT ME</u></h2>
<p><font color=white><font size=5px><center>Hello, my name is Karlo R. Muñoz, I am 20 years old, I currently live at Loakan, Baguio City, 
  I am a BSIT-NetSec student at the University of the Cordilleras. 
  My hobbies and interests are playing video games and being updated on the latest pop culture. As of the moment, 
  my only goal is to finish college so that I could find a decent job that can support my family and interests, 
  but primarily, Im doing it for family. If I don't succeed in the IT field, I would probably just join the military. </center></font></font></p>
